# Introduction and about the project

## Inspiration and Coding Prompt Track

We chose to go down the "Health" prompt, specifically down the inclusivity in health route

## Challenges we ran into
We knew that this would be a project that we might want to work on after the hackathon ended, so we wanted to set this project up using the best industry practices possible. We (tried) using conventional commits (time crunches got us good), but the biggest challenge was when we decided to implement our CI/CD system, that took a lot of time to setup. But it now works!

## Picking the correct techstack and scope for the project. 
We decided to use Vue.js, because we knew the other competitors would know React, as there was an intro to React workshop done the days prior to the hackathon. We wanted to wow the competitors by using Vue.js's specific router library, and while it was tricky to setup, it ended up working!

## Achievements
With only two days, we were able to demonstrate our skills with
- CI/CD
- Contributing to a project with multiple developers in a fast paced environment
- Designing and putting that design to life within a website
- The use of API's, showcased by using Nutrionix's free API
- Vue.js

## Going forward...
- Implement more views, seperating the home and results view!
- Add filtering of areas with the map component within the square mile radius the user specified with his query
- Fully automate the CI/CD with GH-Actions, as we did in the beginning of the project (script running was just faster during the hackathon, but its better practice to use GH-Actions)

# Introduction and about the project

 Inspiration

To help people diet for the gym.
 What it does

Takes in information from the user and calculates the difference from the amount of calories needed and amount of calories eaten. 
 How we built it

We made a home screen that displays the form and for the background we made it a space theme. Then using the api, we would get the nutrition information from the response.
Challenges we ran into

Picking the correct techstack and scope for the project. 
Accomplishments that we're proud of

We were able to make fully functional home screen.
What we learned

We learned how to use vue js, and used apis for the first time.

Features that will come in the future

Implementation of a a backend for the project that can do additional things such as storing information, providing different dietary options.
